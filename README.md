Hi, there! 👋 Hope you are doing great. 😊

# 🚀 About Me

I'm Abhinandan Samal, an Indian 🇮🇳 enthusiast with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering earned in 2016. Presently, I'm passionately pursuing a Master's in Data Science in the vibrant city of Berlin, Germany.🧑‍🎓 🇩🇪

With a rich six-year journey in the IT realm, I have finely crafted my skills and left a substantial impact. At Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) until June 2022, I excelled as an IT Analyst, demonstrating my adaptability as both an ETL developer and Analyst in the dynamic fields of Banking and Insurance. My role encompassed software development, creating recommendation systems, and crafting sentiment analysis, machine learning models. Before this, I served as a BI Support Executive in the Telecom Domain. Transitioning to IBM from July 2022 to June 2023, I embraced the position of Data Engineer and Big Data Developer, further elevating my expertise in the ever-evolving landscape of data technology. Notably, during this period, I earned numerous accolades from clients, Onshore Team Leads, Senior Solution Architects, Offshore Managers, and Solution Architects alike. As a pivotal member of the project, I played a crucial role in assisting solution architects in deciding the optimal data flow architecture.👨‍💻

My journey has been nothing short of remarkable, transitioning from a Mechanical Engineering graduate to a proficient IT professional, advancing from a Support Executive to a skilled Data Engineer with a strong grasp of Data Science technologies. The excitement peaked as I transformed from being perceived as the least performing team member to taking charge of the project's most crucial and intricate module.😎 It has been a rollercoaster of challenges, continuous learning, hard work, unwavering dedication, occasional setbacks, and triumphant successes. In a nutshell, my story is a testament to resilience and growth.😇 Presently, I am pushing my boundaries further by venturing into the realm of Data Science, always eager to embrace new challenges and seize better opportunities.💪👨‍💻

I have worked on multiple personal projects. But I am still learning & fine tuning my skills. Its a never ending process.💡

📌  have a profound passion for a diverse range of subjects including Technology, History, Nature, Architecture, Books, and Philosophy. My enthusiasm extends to devouring books on Personal Development and Autobiography, exploring insightful blogs on Data Science, and immersing myself in tech videos on YouTube. This voracious appetite for knowledge fuels my constant quest for understanding and growth.
