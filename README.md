Hi, there! 👋 

# 🚀 About Me
I am Abhinandan Samal.♋️ I am from India. 🇮🇳 I did my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and graduated in 2016. Currently I am pursing my *Master's degree in Data Science* in Berlin, Germany.🧑‍🎓 🇩🇪

I have total 6 years and 4 months of IT industry experience. I was working as an IT Analyst till June 2022 in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), where I have got the opportunity to work as an ETL developer & an Analyst in Banking & Insurance Domain. I have worked on recommendation system, sentiment analysis & other machine learning models in this period. Before that I was working as a BI Support Executive in Telecom Domain. From July 2022 to June 2023, I was working in IBM as a Data Engineer - Big Data Developer. 👨‍💻

My journey has been nothing short of remarkable, transitioning from a Mechanical Engineering graduate to a proficient IT professional, advancing from a Support Executive to a skilled Data Engineer with a strong grasp of Data Science technologies. The excitement peaked as I transformed from being perceived as the least performing team member to taking charge of the project's most crucial and intricate module.😎 It has been a rollercoaster of challenges, continuous learning, hard work, unwavering dedication, occasional setbacks, and triumphant successes. In a nutshell, my story is a testament to resilience and growth.😇 Presently, I am pushing my boundaries further by venturing into the realm of Data Science, always eager to embrace new challenges and seize better opportunities.💪👨‍💻

I have worked on multiple personal projects. But I am still learning & fine tuning my skills. Its a never ending process.💡

📌 I’m interested in Technology, History, Nature, Architecture, Books & Philosophy. I love reading books on Personal Development & Autobiography, Blogs on Data Science related topics and watching tech videos on YouTube.
